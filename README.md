We're going to fabricate a merge conflict so you can practice how to resolve merge conflicts when they (inevitably) show up.

    1. Create a new file, name it whatever you want
    2. Add something to that file
    3. Create a new branch name that branch whatever you want
    4. Create a new file with the same name as the file you created in step 1
    5. Add something to that second new file, make sure it's different from what you added in step 2
    6. Checkout your main branch
    7. run `git merge <name of branch created in step 3>`
    8. You should get a merge conflict
    9. Resolve the conflict
